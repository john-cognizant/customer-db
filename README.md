# customer-db
ClientA needs a web app to save customer leads. Create an app that fetches customers from a database, displays them in a UI, and is able to add, amend, delete customers as they want. 
You can create your own database using something like https://my-json-server.typicode.com/
or install https://github.com/typicode/json-server to create a localhost db.

Here is an example of a db to help you get started. Please create your own repo and db and do not make changes to this one: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/john-cognizant/customer-db/db
